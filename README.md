## **Hello World**
My name is Owen Schiltz and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Iowa. 
I am studying both Finance, and Business Analytics and Information Systems.
I am a career motivated individual who will put in the hard work to succeed and grow.
I like to challenge myself with different opportunites to get out of my comfort zone and develop different skills.
While being a diligent worker, I am also a sociable person who loves to build long lasting relationships with people.
Some activities that I enjoy doing include playing basketball, reading manga, and listening to music.
